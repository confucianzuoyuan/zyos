# Learning RFT

## A Personal Word of Introduction

As a psychotherapist, I am a child of my time. I grew up in a psychodynamic world dominated by a strong emphasis on understanding, but not—as far as I could see—well anchored in scientific research. It also lacked concrete guidance regarding workable therapeutic interventions. My encounter with cognitive therapy at the end of the 1980s was therefore a liberating experience. Scientific foundation was paramount, and the therapeutic strategies were applicable in my everyday work within psychiatry. Cognitive theory as a basis of psychotherapy has since been victorious—not only in my world, but in the world of psychotherapy at large. Cognitive therapy has gradually been integrated with behavior therapy under the designation of "cognitive behavioral therapies"(CBT), but the different hybrids are dominated by the theories underlying the cognitive model.

作为一名心理治疗师，我是时代的产物。我成长于一个心理动力学的世界，这个世界强调理解，但在我看来并没有很好地扎根于科学研究。它也缺乏有关可行治疗干预的具体指导。因此，当我在1980年代末接触到认知疗法时，这是一次解放的经历。认知疗法强调科学基础至关重要，而且治疗策略可以应用于我的日常精神病学工作中。自那时以来，认知理论作为心理治疗的基础已经获得胜利，在我的世界中以及整个心理治疗领域都占据了主导地位。虽然认知疗法逐渐与行为疗法融合，被称为“认知行为疗法”(CBT)，但不同的杂交品种都以认知模型为基础。

During the 1990s, I progressively found what I saw as shortcomings in cognitive theory. It was difficult to get a clear idea of what the basic terminology was and what scientific support it had. Different cognitive theorists liberally used their different terms to describe what was taking place in the "psyche," and this obscurity and lack of consensus became all the more troublesome due to the assumption that the core of psychological problems was located somewhere inside this unknown realm. In the mid-1990s, I was still largely unaware of any vigorous alternative. I did, however, run into some works that aroused my interest, notably Marsha Linehan's 1993 book on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which revealed a strong influence from classical behavior therapy.

在1990年代，我逐渐发现了认知理论的一些不足之处。很难清楚地了解基本术语及其科学支持的情况。不同的认知理论家随意使用各自的术语来描述"心灵"中正在发生的事情，这种模糊和缺乏共识的情况变得更加麻烦，因为他们假设心理问题的核心位于这个未知领域的某个地方。到了1990年代中期，我对任何强有力的替代方法几乎一无所知。然而，我确实接触到了一些引起我的兴趣的作品，尤其是玛莎·莱恩汉1993年关于辩证行为疗法（DBT）的书籍，其中展现出了古典行为疗法的强烈影响。

Through my interest in affect theory and the use of metaphors, I came into contact with acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a therapy model related to DBT in many respects, but with a much more elaborate theoretical and experimental foundation. Once again I was provided with new, useful tools. In addition, I found myself in more extensive contact with the new theoretical approach ACT had been built on, as well as with classical learning theory as a basis for psychological therapy. I realized that one cannot really understand ACT, much less its theoretical foundation, relational frame theory (RFT), without an understanding of basic behavioral principles—that is, operant and respondent conditioning. Once I gradually became familiar with these principles, I discovered what I have come to regard as the most promising psychological model available when it comes to understanding human behavior in a way that also contributes directly to the therapeutic work for change. This led to an inspiring dialogue with my good friend Jonas Ramnerö, who'd had a somewhat longer history with behavioral psychology than I had. This dialogue resulted in our writing a book together: The ABCs of Human Behavior: Behavioral Principles for the Practicing Clinician.

通过我对情感理论和隐喻的兴趣，我接触到了接受与承诺治疗（ACT），这是一种与DBT在许多方面相关的治疗模型，但它具有更加详尽的理论和实验基础。再次，我获得了新的、有用的工具。此外，我发现自己与ACT所建立的新理论方法以及作为心理治疗基础的古典学习理论有更广泛的接触。我意识到，如果没有对基本行为原则——即操作性和条件反射条件——的理解，就无法真正理解ACT，更不用说它的理论基础关系框架理论（RFT）了。一旦我逐渐熟悉了这些原则，我发现它是目前最有前途的心理模型之一，可以在理解人类行为的同时直接为改变治疗工作做出贡献。这导致我与我的好朋友乔纳斯·拉姆内罗进行了一次启发性的对话，他对行为心理学的历史比我更长。这个对话最终促成了我们合作撰写一本书：《人类行为的ABC：实践临床医生的行为原则》。

Recent years have seen a growing interest in behavioral principles, not least among psychotherapists with cognitive training. This new interest has given me a reason to work more thoroughly on the issue that has engaged me for quite a few years by now: the issue of the power of thinking in relation to other human behavior and the role this plays in the problems that make people seek help in psychotherapy. My purpose in this book is to elucidate the behavioral perspective on this question. You might say that this book attempts to respond to the questions raised by cognitive theory and therapy, although the answers are given from a different point of departure than those common to cognitive approaches. Instead, the starting point here is the foundation laid down years ago in the shape of operant and respondent conditioning. Behavioral psychology has long had problems in applying its basic agenda of prediction and influence in this area. I think these problems are coming to an end. The increasing basic research performed to describe relational conditioning and the theoretical structure that has evolved around this phenomenon (RFT) provides new answers and opens the door to new interventions in respect to cognition and human language. All this is done from the agenda of classical behavioral therapy, with new interventions being founded upon data from experimental research.

近年来，行为原则越来越受到关注，尤其是在接受认知训练的心理治疗师中间。这种新的兴趣使我有了更充分的理由去深入研究我多年来一直关注的问题：思考在人类行为中的力量以及在导致人们寻求心理治疗帮助的问题中所起的作用。我的目的是在本书中阐述行为观点对这个问题的看法。你可以说，这本书试图回答认知理论和治疗所提出的问题，尽管答案是从与认知方法不同的出发点给出的。这里的起点是多年前形成的操作性和条件反射条件。行为心理学长期以来一直在应用其预测和影响的基本议程方面存在问题。我认为这些问题正在结束。对关系条件性进行描述的基础研究日益增多，围绕这一现象形成的理论结构（RFT）提供了新的答案，并为认知和人类语言方面的新干预措施打开了大门。所有这些都是从古典行为疗法的议程出发进行的，新的干预措施是建立在实验研究数据基础上的。

For me to begin this book by contrasting its content with psychodynamic and cognitive models may seem provocative and deprecating. This is not my intention. I am aware that the psychodynamic and cognitive theories that I earlier found unsatisfactory have not stayed unchanged since my point of departure; they have been developing in their own way. Moreover, I believe that a behavioral perspective is integrative in nature. Behavioral psychology is not about one specific model of therapy; it describes fundamental, universal principles of behavior. It is legitimate to approach anything and everything a person does from this perspective. Behavioral psychology is not limited in scope to phenomena that are easy to observe and define, like when someone avoids air travel or washes her hands obsessively. It also applies to behaviors in the close interactions between people that are harder to capture, like establishing and maintaining close relationships or behaving toward the therapist much like one earlier behaved toward a parent. Even behavior that in many ways seems concealed to anyone other than the person who is doing it, like dwelling on past grudges or struggling with feelings of dejection, can be approached from this perspective. The same goes for behaviors that are rarely the focus in psychotherapy, like playing the flute or writing poetry.

对于我开始这本书，通过将其内容与心理动力学和认知模型进行对比，可能会显得挑衅和贬低。这并不是我的意图。我知道，我之前认为不令人满意的心理动力学和认知理论自我的出发点以来已经发生了变化；它们一直在自己的方式上发展。此外，我相信行为观点是综合性的。行为心理学不仅仅是一种特定的治疗模型；它描述了行为的基本、普遍原则。从这个角度来看，可以处理一个人所做的任何事情。行为心理学的范围不仅限于容易观察和定义的现象，比如某人避免乘飞机或过度洗手。它还适用于人与人之间密切互动中更难以捕捉的行为，比如建立和维护亲密关系或像以前对待父母一样对待治疗师的行为。即使是在许多方面似乎只有做这件事的人才能看到的行为，比如沉迷于过去的怨恨或挣扎于沮丧的感觉，也可以从这个角度来处理。同样，对于在心理治疗中很少成为焦点的行为，比如演奏长笛或写诗，也同样适用。

Thus, nothing human is alien to behavioral psychology. All human phenomena that take place in time and space and that can be the subject of attention in psychodynamic or cognitive therapy can also be approached from this perspective, hence its integrative nature. But the starting point of this analysis is a given theoretical position: the one which, since the days of Skinner, has been designated “radical behaviorism.” Some of this is novel, but the foundation was laid quite a few years back.

因此，行为心理学没有任何人类现象是陌生的。所有发生在时间和空间中的人类现象，无论是心理动力学或认知治疗中可以受到关注的对象，都可以从这个角度来处理，因此具有综合性。但是，这种分析的起点是一个特定的理论立场：自从斯金纳时代以来被称为“激进行为主义”的理论立场。其中一些是新颖的，但基础是在相当多年前奠定的。

### A WORD ON TERMINOLOGY

Skinner called the science of behavior that he developed behavior analysis. However, this term is used in slightly different ways. Within behavior therapy in Europe, it is sometimes used synonymously with the word “conceptualization.” In this usage, a behavior analysis is understood as an initial phase of behavior therapy. I will be using the term in the way Skinner did, which is how it is still used in the United States. Used in this way, “behavior analysis” is a designation of the science, as a whole, that aims at predicting and influencing behavior, along with the practical work involved in doing this. There is usually a distinction made between two branches within behavior analysis: experimental behavior analysis and applied behavior analysis. Experimental analysis of behavior is the type of experimental activity usually connected with Skinner: Under carefully monitored conditions, different factors are varied to determine whether an organism’s behavior can be predicted and influenced. In applied behavior analysis, the basic principles that can be described following the experimental work are applied to different types of problems “out there, in real life.” A branch of applied behavior analysis is clinical behavior analysis. This is behavior analysis in the field commonly referred to as psychotherapy. Consequently, in our book The ABCs of Human Behavior: Behavioral Principles for the Practicing Clinician (2008), Jonas Ramnerö and I called this field of application “behavioral psychotherapy.” In this book, however, I will mainly be using the term “clinical behavior analysis.”

斯金纳称他所发展的行为科学为行为分析。然而，这个术语有稍微不同的用法。在欧洲的行为疗法中，它有时被用作“概念化”的同义词。在这种用法中，行为分析被理解为行为疗法的初始阶段。我将使用斯金纳的方式来使用这个术语，这也是在美国仍然使用的方式。在这种用法中，“行为分析”是指旨在预测和影响行为的整个科学及其实践工作的称号。通常在行为分析中区分两个分支：实验行为分析和应用行为分析。行为的实验分析通常与斯金纳有关：在仔细监控的条件下，不同的因素被改变以确定是否可以预测和影响生物的行为。在应用行为分析中，可以根据实验工作后得出的基本原则应用于不同类型的“现实生活中”的问题。应用行为分析的一个分支是临床行为分析。这是通常被称为心理治疗的领域中的行为分析。因此，在我们的书《人类行为的ABC：实践临床医生的行为原则》（2008）中，Jonas Ramnerö和我将这个应用领域称为“行为心理治疗”。然而，在这本书中，我主要会使用“临床行为分析”这个术语。

### OUTLINE

This book is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides some important background. Chapter 1 offers a short account of basic and well-known principles of learning from the viewpoint of radical behaviorism, with a particular emphasis on concepts that must be understood in order to become familiar with RFT. Chapter 2 provides a survey of how behavior analysis had tried to tackle “the power of thinking” before the experimental data on which RFT is based were available. The bulk of this chapter consists of an overview of Skinner’s analysis of verbal behavior. Although his analysis has limitations (described here as well), it remains important as a backdrop to RFT. In chapter 3, arguments for renewed inquiry into human cognition and language conclude part 1 of the book.

这本书分为三个部分。第一部分提供了一些重要的背景知识。第1章从激进行为主义的角度简要介绍了基本和众所周知的学习原则，并特别强调了必须理解的与RFT相关的概念。第2章概述了在RFT基础实验数据出现之前，行为分析如何尝试解决“思考的力量”问题。本章的主要部分是对斯金纳关于言语行为分析的概述。尽管他的分析有局限性（在这里也进行了描述），但它仍然是RFT的背景重要组成部分。第3章讨论了重新探究人类认知和语言的论点，这标志着本书的第一部分的结束。

Part 2 of the book is its core; this is where RFT is described. Chapter 4 presents and defines RFT’s basic terminology and describes the type of experiments the theory is based on. In essence, chapter 4 describes the fundamental elements in human language. In chapters 5 and 6, I have attempted to show how these building blocks are combined with an increasing degree of complexity, and how they cast new light on complex human behavior. In chapter 7, part 2 concludes with an account of the problems that verbal (cognitive) behavior creates for human beings, or the side effects of human language.

本书的第二部分是其核心内容；这里介绍了RFT。第4章介绍和定义了RFT的基本术语，并描述了该理论基于的实验类型。本质上，第4章描述了人类语言中的基本要素。在第5和第6章中，我试图展示这些构建块如何与越来越复杂的程度相结合，以及它们如何为复杂的人类行为提供新的视角。在第7章中，第二部分以描述语言（认知）行为对人类产生的问题或人类语言的副作用的方式结束。

Part 3 of the book describes clinical applications. Chapter 8 takes a look at psychological therapies in general from a behavioral perspective. The remaining three chapters focus on clinical behavior analysis, with particular emphasis on strategies and techniques based in RFT.

本书的第三部分描述了临床应用。第8章从行为学的角度概述了心理治疗。其余三章重点介绍了临床行为分析，特别强调基于RFT的策略和技术。

### THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK

The number of scientific texts presenting RFT and its experimental base is growing rapidly. The same is true for books presenting ACT. This book has the character of being in between these two categories of texts. Although the purpose is to give an overall introduction to RFT, the book has its limitations. The main limitation lies in maintaining both a theoretical and a clinical perspective. Though RFT is based on experimental research, this book does not present the experimental work in detail; it simply gives an outline of the experimental work and devotes more attention to the conclusions drawn from that work. This book is more focused on concepts than data and details, partly to give a general introduction, and partly to give an understanding that facilitates clinical work. The book does not include more detailed presentations of the experiments in their entirety, such as how they are arranged and performed. I have tried, however, to frequently refer to literature that contains such presentations so that the interested reader can find more in-depth material. There is also a paradox involved in this limitation. There is a degree of learning RFT that can be achieved only by engaging in experimental work. Yet this is a book by someone who has never done that, written primarily for others in the same situation. Experimental psychologists will probably find lack of precision and technical detail. The same might be true of others who are very well acquainted with the existing scientific literature. At the same time, some readers will probably find parts of the book too technical and abstract. Still, this kind of book, “in between,” is what I wished to read when I first encountered RFT. Hopefully it will be helpful to others who are now in the situation I was in then.

介绍RFT及其实验基础的科学文献数量正在迅速增长。介绍ACT的书籍也是如此。这本书处于这两类文献之间。虽然旨在总体介绍RFT，但本书也有其局限性。主要局限在于保持理论和临床视角。尽管RFT基于实验研究，但本书并未详细介绍实验工作；它仅概述了实验工作，并更多地关注了从这些工作中得出的结论。本书更加关注概念而非数据和细节，部分原因是为了提供一般介绍，部分原因是为了提供有助于临床工作的理解。本书不包括实验的更详细的全面介绍，例如它们是如何安排和执行的。然而，我已经努力引用包含这些介绍的文献，以便感兴趣的读者可以找到更深入的材料。这种局限性也涉及到一个悖论。只有通过参与实验工作才能达到一定程度的学习RFT。然而，这是一本由从未进行过实验工作的人撰写的书籍，主要是为了帮助处于同样情况的其他人。实验心理学家可能会发现缺乏精确性和技术细节。其他非常熟悉现有科学文献的人可能也会有同样的感受。同时，一些读者可能会认为本书的某些部分过于技术性和抽象。尽管如此，在这种“中间”的书籍是我在第一次接触RFT时希望阅读的内容。希望它对现在处于我当时情况下的其他人有所帮助。

ACT has a central position in part 3 of the book, on clinical applications. This is only natural, as this therapeutic model has evolved together with RFT. Alongside ACT, other forms of clinical behavior analysis, especially functional analytical psychotherapy and behavioral activation, have their place. It has not been my goal, however, to present any of these individual models in their entirety, or to carry out an in-depth comparison. I want to pursue the agenda outlined in The ABCs of Human Behavior (Ramnerö & Törneke, 2008): to describe psychological therapy from the broad perspective of radical behaviorism, and to describe the therapeutic tradition that can be called behavior therapy, behavioral psychotherapy, or clinical behavior analysis. I want to do this with a special emphasis on how an understanding of RFT adds some new elements to this tradition.

ACT在本书的第三部分，即临床应用中占据了核心地位。这是很自然的，因为这种治疗模式是与RFT一起发展的。除了ACT之外，其他形式的临床行为分析，尤其是功能性分析心理治疗和行为激活，也有其位置。然而，我的目标不是全面介绍这些个体模型，也不是进行深入比较。我想追求《人类行为的ABC》（Ramnerö＆Törneke，2008）中概述的议程：从激进行为主义的广泛视角描述心理治疗，并描述可以称为行为疗法、行为心理治疗或临床行为分析的治疗传统。我想特别强调，了解RFT如何为这一传统增加了一些新元素。

## PART 1 Background

### Chapter 1 Radical Behaviorism and Fundamental Behavior Analytic Principles

Radical behaviorism is the philosophical basis on which B. F. Skinner built his psychology (1953). This term has caused a lot of debate over the years. It has also frequently been misunderstood, sometimes to such a degree that one might wonder if the term is useful at all or if it has actually become an obstacle to introducing the psychology itself. It is common to see Skinner’s views described as superficial and coarsely mechanistic, even in psychology textbooks (Power & Dalgleish, 1997, pp. 35-36; Solso, MacLin, & MacLin, 2005, p. 329). This is in stark contrast to my own impression from reading Skinner, and I have often wondered if writers who portray his positions in this way have actually read his works. Be that as it may, his positions, and the terms he uses to describe them, are controversial, and the term “radical behaviorism” is a clear example of that. An alternative and more modern term is functional contextualism (Gifford & Hayes, 1999). This alternative term may better convey in what way this particular philosophy of science relates to other modern approaches. It puts Skinner’s position in relation to alternative types of contextualism, such as social constructivism or certain types of feminism (Roche & Barnes-Holmes, 2003; Gifford & Hayes, 1999). The term “functional contextualism” emphasizes two essential elements in radical behaviorism: The first is that behavior must always be understood in relation to the setting, or context, in which it takes place. The second is that in order to understand and influence behavior, we need to study its function—that is, what it is aimed at.

激进行为主义是B·F·斯金纳（1953年）建立其心理学的哲学基础。多年来，这个术语引起了很多争议。它也经常被误解，有时甚至误解到让人怀疑这个术语是否有用，或者它是否实际上成为介绍心理学本身的障碍。通常可以看到，即使在心理学教科书中（Power＆Dalgleish，1997年，第35-36页；Solso，MacLin和MacLin，2005年，第329页），斯金纳的观点也被描述为肤浅和粗略的机械主义。这与我从读斯金纳的作品中获得的印象形成了鲜明对比，我经常想知道将他的立场描述成这样的作家是否真正读过他的作品。无论如何，他的立场和他用来描述它们的术语都是有争议的，“激进行为主义”这个术语就是一个明显的例子。另一个更现代的术语是功能情境主义（Gifford＆Hayes，1999年）。这个替代术语可能更好地传达了这种特定科学哲学与其他现代方法的关系。它将斯金纳的立场与其他类型的情境主义联系起来，例如社会建构主义或某些类型的女性主义（Roche＆Barnes-Holmes，2003年；Gifford＆Hayes，1999年）。术语“功能情境主义”强调激进行为主义中两个基本要素：第一是行为必须始终在其发生的环境或情境中理解。第二是为了理解和影响行为，我们需要研究其功能，即它的目标是什么。

My reason for using the term “radical behaviorism” to start out with, despite the above discussion, is that this is the term that has survived and is widely accepted among those who follow in Skinner’s footsteps in their work. It is linguistically correct, and it also brings out some essential elements of the position on which this book is based.

尽管上述讨论，我之所以选择使用“激进行为主义”这个术语作为起点的原因是，这个术语在那些在斯金纳的工作中追随他脚步的人中得到了广泛接受和使用。它在语言上是正确的，同时也揭示了本书基于的一些基本要素。

#### BEHAVIORISM AND ITS PREMISES

Let’s begin with a discussion of the more general term “behaviorism.” This is a broad term that encompasses many partly differing approaches (O’Donohue & Kitchener, 1998). Yet these approaches have certain premises in common, making the concept of behaviorism appropriate. The most fundamental premise was made clear by Watson, who came up with the term “behaviorism.” In this approach, what is in focus is behavior (Watson, 1929); that is, something a person—or any other organism—is doing. The actions, or responses, of the whole organism are in focus. Another premise that the different approaches have in common is the method of seeking knowledge: The science is to be built from the bottom up. The quest is for fundamental, universally valid principles for understanding behavior. This means that laboratory experiments have a strong position. When carrying out experiments, a key concept is to try to minimize noncontrollable variables as much as possible before going on to identify and systematically manipulate those variables that are essential. In many ways this resembles how psychoanalysts are strict about the setting for their sessions, so as to eliminate irrelevant disturbances and observe relevant, governing phenomena in the interaction taking place. The most well-known, classical examples of this method within behaviorism are perhaps Skinner’s experiments with pigeons and rats. The environment is stripped (there is only a box), and the relevant variables are few (the box contains a bar that enables the animal to act in order to receive food, and a light that is turned on and off). What is important here is not the laboratory experiments as such, or even the actions of pigeons or rats; rather, the aim in using this method is to be able to identify principles underlying the behavior of organisms—principles that can then be used to understand more complex processes that perhaps cannot be studied in laboratories.

让我们首先讨论更一般的术语“行为主义”。这是一个广泛的术语，涵盖了许多部分不同的方法（O'Donohue＆Kitchener，1998年）。然而，这些方法有一些共同的前提条件，使得行为主义这个概念合适。最基本的前提条件由沃森明确提出，他提出了“行为主义”这个术语。在这种方法中，关注的是行为（Watson，1929年）；也就是说，一个人或任何其他生物正在做的事情。整个生物的行动或反应是重点。不同方法共同具有的另一个前提条件是寻求知识的方法：科学应该从底层开始建立。追求的是理解行为的基本、普遍有效的原则。这意味着实验室实验具有重要地位。在进行实验时，关键概念是尽可能减少不可控制的变量，然后识别和系统地操作那些至关重要的变量。在许多方面，这类似于精神分析师对他们的诊疗环境要求严格，以消除不相关的干扰并观察互动中相关的主导现象。在行为主义中，最著名、经典的例子可能是斯金纳对鸽子和老鼠的实验。环境被简化（只有一个箱子），相关变量很少（箱子里有一个杆子，动物可以通过它来获取食物，还有一个可以开关的灯）。重要的是，这里重要的不是实验室实验本身，甚至不是鸽子或老鼠的行为；而是使用这种方法的目的是能够识别出支配生物行为的原则，然后用这些原则来理解可能无法在实验室中研究的更复杂的过程。

This reveals another premise of behaviorism: that of an assumed continuity across different organisms. Research on pigeons, for example, is used to draw conclusions about human beings, at least in certain respects. This has sometimes been a point of controversy, especially among psychotherapists. Is it possible to understand humans based on an understanding of animals? This was the topic of heated discussion during the 1960s and 1970s, but a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. Today, it is uncontroversial to say that evolutionary psychology and neuropsychology, as well as ethology, hold firm positions in shaping various theories within psychotherapy, regardless of the specific camp. Based on an evolutionary perspective, researchers who have greatly influenced different psychotherapy traditions, such as John Bowlby (attachment theory) and Joseph LeDoux (affect theory), take the same view as what Skinner once maintained: simply stated, that evolution continuously builds on what is already at hand. Functions that work are not removed; they become building blocks in future developments. This is why we can learn a lot about human beings by studying how gorillas relate to their offspring (attachment theory) or by studying basic cerebral functions in animals (affect theory).

这揭示了行为主义的另一个前提条件：假设不同生物之间存在连续性。例如，对鸽子的研究被用来得出关于人类的结论，至少在某些方面是如此。这有时成为争议的焦点，特别是在心理治疗师中间。基于对动物的理解，能否理解人类？这是在20世纪60年代和70年代引发激烈讨论的话题，但自那时以来，很多事情已经发生了变化。今天，毫无争议地可以说，进化心理学、神经心理学以及行为学在塑造心理治疗中的各种理论中占据了坚实的地位，无论具体阵营如何。基于进化的角度，对不同心理治疗传统产生深远影响的研究人员，如约翰·鲍尔比（依恋理论）和约瑟夫·勒杜（情感理论），持有与斯金纳曾经坚持的相同观点：简而言之，进化不断在现有基础上构建。有效的功能不会被移除；它们成为未来发展的基石。这就是为什么通过研究大猩猩与后代的关系（依恋理论）或通过研究动物的基本脑功能（情感理论），我们可以对人类学到很多东西。

Now, if behavior is what is to be studied, the question is how we define this term. What should be counted as behavior? The answer to this question can be expressed in somewhat different ways within behaviorism, and in order to account for what is meant by behavior in this book, I will now turn to Skinner’s view on this, as encapsulated in the term “radical behaviorism.”

现在，如果行为是要研究的对象，问题是我们如何定义这个术语。什么应该被视为行为？在行为主义内部，对这个问题的回答可以用不同的方式表达。为了解释本书中所指的行为，我将转向斯金纳对此的看法，这体现在“激进行为主义”这个术语中。

#### WHAT IS RADICAL ABOUT RADICAL BEHAVIORISM?

Being radical can be taken as being extreme. This is not what Skinner had in mind, though, when he chose the term “radical.” In this context, “radical” implies not “extreme” but “consistent.” Radical behaviorism entails not a departure from fundamental behavioristic principles but the application of them in an all-inclusive way. This has some consequences. For example, take the principle that Skinner used to describe operant conditioning (more on this below). This principle implies that our actions are influenced by the consequences we have previously encountered following a particular action. The probability that a pigeon will peck at a certain point increases if it has earlier received food after pecking at that particular point. But if this is to be applied in a consistent way, in keeping with Skinner’s position, then this principle also holds for me as a scientist. I do what I do (in my experiment with the pigeon) as a consequence of outcomes of similar experimentation earlier. As a scientist, I do not hold any objective or exclusive position. I am not outside or above the principles I study. If this understanding is applied consistently, all claims of representing the ontological truth have to be dropped. Based on this position, we cannot maintain that “this is the way it really is.” Radical behaviorists repudiate the notion that the scientist operates from an objective and neutral position. As mentioned earlier, from the perspective of radical behaviorism you cannot understand behavior without studying its context. All behavior takes place within a context. But neither can the context be studied independent of behavior. This is because the scientist’s attempt to study something is a behavior as well. After all, the object of our study is something that we are acting upon, just by studying it. So just as we cannot understand behavior without context, there is no context available for the organism without behavior.

“激进”可以被理解为“极端”。然而，当斯金纳选择“激进”这个术语时，并不是指这个意思。在这个背景下，“激进”意味着不是“极端”，而是“一致”。激进行为主义不仅涉及到基本行为主义原则的运用，而且还包括了所有包容性的方面。这有一些后果。例如，以斯金纳用来描述操作性条件作用的原则为例（稍后会详细介绍）。这个原则意味着，我们的行为受到我们之前遇到的特定行为后果的影响。如果鸽子之前在某个特定点啄食后得到了食物，则鸽子在那个特定点啄食的概率会增加。但是，如果要根据斯金纳的观点一致地运用这个原则，那么这个原则也适用于我作为一名科学家。我所做的事情（在与鸽子的实验中）是由之前类似实验的结果决定的。作为一名科学家，我没有任何客观或独特的立场。我不是在我研究的原则之外或之上。如果一致地应用这种理解，所有代表本体论真理的主张都必须被放弃。基于这种立场，我们不能坚持“这就是真实情况”的说法。激进行为主义者否认科学家从客观和中立的立场进行操作的观念。正如前面提到的，从激进行为主义的角度来看，如果没有研究其背景，就无法理解行为。所有行为都发生在一个背景中。但是，背景也不能独立于行为进行研究。这是因为科学家试图研究某些东西也是一种行为。毕竟，我们研究的对象就是我们正在研究它的东西。因此，正如我们无法理解没有背景的行为一样，没有行为可供研究的生物也没有背景。

This point about the behavior of the scientist is also true in a more general sense. Stimulus and response (behavior) are codependent and should be considered together. They make up a single unity (Kantor, 1970). We can separate them for practical reasons, with a certain aim in mind. And the behavioral science that Skinner wanted to create has an aim: to predict and influence behavior. Radical behaviorists are not claiming to be “uncovering reality”; rather, we maintain that this method, the scientific project of radical behaviorism, is a method that works for what we want to do. The pigeon in Skinner’s experiment could say something similar: “Pecking this spot works when it comes to getting Skinner to give me food.”

科学家的行为也在更一般的意义上成立。刺激和反应（行为）是相互依存的，应该一起考虑。它们构成了一个整体（坎托，1970年）。出于实际原因，我们可以将它们分开，追求特定的目标。斯金纳希望建立的行为科学有一个目标：预测和影响行为。激进行为主义者并不声称自己“揭示了现实”，相反，我们坚持认为这个方法，即激进行为主义的科学项目，是我们想要做的事情的有效方法。斯金纳实验中的鸽子可能会说类似的话：“啄食这个地方对于让斯金纳给我食物是有效的。”

When we radically apply the fundamental principles of behavior that we have identified, this leads to another important result, one involving the definition of the term “behavior.” In everyday speech, the word “behavior” normally refers only to external actions, which can be observed by anyone else who is present. So how should we regard the things a person does but that no one except the person himself can observe, things like feeling, remembering, and thinking? Traditionally, these phenomena have been assigned to another sphere—the psyche—as if they were of a different nature than the things we can observe. Here too, Skinner called for consistency, maintaining that there is nothing to indicate that the same principles are not valid for these phenomena as well (Skinner, 1953, 1974). This means these phenomena are also behavior, and that they can and should be analyzed according to the same principles as behavior that is observable by others.

当我们彻底应用已经确定的行为基本原则时，这将导致另一个重要的结果，涉及到对术语“行为”的定义。在日常语言中，“行为”一词通常仅指他人可以观察到的外部行动。那么，我们应该如何看待一个人所做的事情，但除了他自己之外没有人能够观察到的事情，比如感受、记忆和思考？传统上，这些现象被归类到另一个领域——心理，好像它们与我们可以观察到的事物性质不同。在这方面，斯金纳提出了一致性的要求，坚持认为没有任何迹象表明这些现象不适用于相同的原则（斯金纳，1953年，1974年）。这意味着这些现象也是行为，并且它们可以和应该根据其他人可以观察到的行为相同的原则进行分析。

#### FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIOR ANALYTIC PRINCIPLES

What, then, are the fundamental principles demonstrated by and studied through experimental research that we can use to understand and influence behavior? For a more detailed answer to this question, the reader is referred to other publications (Catania, 2007; Ramnerö & Törneke, 2008). Still, I will provide a short summary here, before turning to this book’s main quest, which is to point out how these principles should be used to shed light upon the function of human thinking.

根据实验研究所证明的基本原则，我们能够用来理解和影响行为是什么？对于这个问题的更详细的答案，读者可以参考其他出版物（Catania，2007；Ramnerö＆Törneke，2008）。但在讨论本书的主要问题之前，我将在此提供一个简短的总结，这个问题是指出这些原则应该如何用来阐明人类思维的功能。

The two fundamental principles for behavior analysis are operant and respondent conditioning. The latter has been described since Pavlov’s well-known experiment with dogs at the beginning of the twentieth century, including how their natural reaction of salivation can be influenced through conditioning. Operant conditioning is the principle of learning that Skinner investigated and demonstrated via his experiments, so that is where I will begin.

行为分析的两个基本原则是操作性条件作用和经典条件作用。后者自二十世纪初以来就被描述，包括巴甫洛夫在狗身上进行的著名实验，展示了他们的自然反应——流口水如何通过条件作用而受到影响。操作性条件作用是斯金纳通过他的实验研究并证明的学习原则，因此我将从这里开始。

`Operant Conditioning: Learning Through Consequences`

Human actions never take place in a vacuum. There is something preceding and something following each action. It is among these contextual factors—those that precede and those that follow—that the behavioral analyst looks for answers to questions about what governs behavior. If someone, in a certain context, turns his eyes to me with a specific expression on his face, I might address him by saying something like “Can I help you?” My utterance is followed by a new occurrence: The person replies. So my action is followed by a consequence, in this case that someone answers me. The core principle in operant conditioning is that the consequences following a behavior (a response) influence the probability of the behavior being repeated. Let’s speculate a bit using two rather different consequences in the everyday example above. Imagine that what follows upon my utterance “Can I help you?” is that the person gives me a friendly smile and tells me what he wants. An alternative would be the response “Mind your own business, you jerk!” It is hard to say exactly how each of these consequences might influence the probability of me asking if I could help if someone else were to look at me with this specific facial expression in the future. What is essential is that earlier consequences do have an influence. “A burned child shuns the fire” is an old saying in Swedish, corresponding to “Once bitten, twice shy” in English. A well-known author has turned this “truth” around in a book entitled Burned Child Seeks the Fire (Edvardson, 1997). It is not always easy to determine what kind of behavior to expect based on previous consequences. But the saying and the author agree on one thing: Previous consequences have an influence. This is the core of operant learning.

人类的行为从不是孤立发生的。每个行为之前都有某种先兆，每个行为之后都有某种后果。行为分析师在这些前后环境因素中寻找答案，以回答关于行为规律的问题。如果某人在特定的情境下用一种特定的表情看着我，我可能会对他说：“我能帮你吗？”我的话语之后会发生一件新的事情：那个人会回答我。所以我的行为会产生一个后果，即有人回答我。操作性条件作用的核心原则是，行为（反应）之后的后果影响该行为重复的概率。让我们假设一下，在上面的日常例子中使用两种截然不同的后果。想象一下，在我说“我能帮你吗？”之后，那个人给我一个友好的微笑，并告诉我他想要什么。另一种可能是回答：“少管闲事，混蛋！”很难准确地说每个后果如何影响我在将来如果有其他人用这种特定的面部表情看着我时是否会再次询问是否能帮忙。重要的是，先前的后果确实有影响。“烫伤过的孩子怕火”是瑞典的一句古老谚语，相当于英语中的“一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳”。一位著名作家在一本名为《烫伤过的孩子寻求火焰》（Edvardson，1997）的书中将这个“真理”颠倒了过来。根据先前的后果来确定预期行为并不总是容易的。但这句谚语和这位作者在一个问题上达成了一致：先前的后果有影响力。这就是操作性学习的核心。

In operant psychology, the different influences of consequences are categorized based on whether they increase or reduce the probability of an earlier behavior being repeated. If I get friendly responses to utterances like the one above and thereafter more often address people who exhibit the same type of facial expression in similar situations, the friendly responses would be said to have had a reinforcing effect on this specific behavior of mine. A consequence that increases the probability of the preceding behavior being repeated is thus termed reinforcing. In this case the reinforcing consequence is that I receive something: a friendly response. Something is added. This kind of process is called positive reinforcement.

在操作性心理学中，根据后果是否增加或减少早期行为被重复的概率，将不同的影响归类。如果我在类似情况下对上述话语得到友好的回应，并在此后更经常地与在类似情况下表现出相同面部表情的人交谈，那么这些友好的回应将被视为对我的这种特定行为产生了强化作用。增加早期行为被重复的概率的后果被称为强化。在这种情况下，强化后果是我收到了某些东西：友好的回应。有东西被添加了。这种过程称为正向强化。

A behavior can also be reinforced through a consequence consisting of something being removed. This is illustrated by the behavior of the person who responded to my question by saying, “Mind your own business, you jerk!” Let’s assume that when this is uttered, I become quiet and turn my attention away from the speaker. I do what I am told to do. This consequence could increase the probability of the other person repeating the utterance “Mind your own business” in similar situations in the future. The consequence—that I became quiet and turned away—has in this case become reinforcing to this person’s behavior of telling off jerks. This time, though, the reinforcement consists of something being removed, namely, the attention from a jerk. When a behavior increases because something is removed, it is termed negative reinforcement.

行为也可以通过一种去除的后果来被强化。这可以通过回答我的问题说：“少管闲事，混蛋！”的人的行为来说明。假设当这句话说出来时，我变得安静并将注意力从说话者身上转移开。我做了我被告知要做的事情。这个后果可能会增加其他人在将来类似情况下重复说“少管闲事”的概率。这个后果——我变得安静并转身离开——在这种情况下已经成为强化这个人训斥混蛋的行为。不过，这次强化是通过去除某些东西来实现的，即从混蛋那里获得的关注。当一种行为因为某些东西被去除而增加时，它被称为负向强化。

Distinguishing between positive and negative reinforcement (which are both processes that increase the probability of a certain behavior) is not always essential. These two concepts can be said to describe two different sides of the same thing (Michael, 1975). If the behavior of telling off jerks was reinforced by me becoming quiet, then one factor is that my annoying questions came to an end. This is negative reinforcement. But another way of describing the same thing is to note the condition that resulted: silence, for example, or anything else that was added. That would be positive reinforcement. It is often convenient to distinguish between positive and negative reinforcement, even though the difference may not be clear-cut from a theoretical perspective. It may sometimes be more obvious that something is removed than that something is added. By speaking about this as negative reinforcement, we clarify the process. The distinction is often practical in clinical situations, a subject I will return to in part 3 of the book.

区分正向强化和负向强化（它们都是增加某种行为的过程）并不总是必要的。这两个概念可以说是描述同一件事情的两个不同方面（Michael，1975）。如果训斥混蛋的行为是通过我变得安静而得到强化，那么一个因素是我的烦人问题停止了。这是负向强化。但是另一种描述同一件事情的方式是注意到所产生的条件：例如沉默或其他任何被添加的东西。那就是正向强化。尽管从理论角度来看这种差异可能不是很明显，但通常区分正向强化和负向强化还是很方便的。有时候去除某些东西比添加某些东西更容易被注意到。通过将其称为负向强化，我们可以澄清这个过程。在临床情况下，这种区分通常是实用的，我将在本书的第三部分中返回这个主题。

When a consequence reduces the probability of a certain behavior being repeated, it is known as punishment. If I receive an unfriendly response in the example above and I subsequently refrain from addressing people in that specific social context or do so less often, then the earlier consequence has been punishing. Punishment, too, can be separated into positive punishment—in which something has been added—and negative punishment—in which something has been removed. Remember, however, that there is no way of determining what is reinforcing versus punishing based on any intrinsic quality that signifies the consequence as such. Of course, it is true that some consequences more often function as reinforcing to people, for example, certain types of social attention. But this is not always the case. To be recognized and addressed in a kind way is usually reinforcing for human behavior, but we can all think of situations when this is something we want to avoid. Likewise, certain consequences usually function in a punishing way, like being hit, yet this is not always the case. There are situations when being hit reinforces the behavior that preceded this consequence. A child who encounters only indifference, despite several actions meant to attract attention, may repeat a behavior that leads to getting smacked, simply because the smack involves attention. It is the function of the consequence that provides the definition. When the consequences increase the probability of a certain behavior, this is reinforcement; and when the consequences reduce the probability of a behavior, it is punishment. To recap:

当一个后果减少某种行为被重复的概率时，它被称为惩罚。如果在上面的例子中我得到了不友好的回应，然后在同样的社交环境中我避免与人交谈或者减少这样的行为，那么之前的后果就是一种惩罚。惩罚也可以分为正向惩罚——添加了某些东西——和负向惩罚——去除了某些东西。然而，请记住，并没有办法根据任何内在的品质来确定什么是强化和惩罚，以及这些后果本身的意义。当然，某些后果更常常作为对人们的强化，例如某些类型的社交关注。但这并不总是如此。被善待和得到关注通常对人类行为有强化作用，但我们都可以想象到有些情况下我们希望避免这种情况。同样，某些后果通常以一种惩罚的方式起作用，比如被打击，但并非总是如此。有些情况下，被打击强化了之前的行为。一个只遇到冷漠对待，尽管采取了几次吸引注意力的行动，但仍会重复导致被打击的行为，仅仅因为打击涉及到了注意力。后果的功能决定了定义。当后果增加了某种行为的概率时，这是强化；当后果减少了某种行为的概率时，这是惩罚。简而言之：
